# Common Dart List Iteration Techniques

This repository demonstrates three common ways to iterate over a list in Dart.  The code is simple but illustrates important concepts for beginners and a refresher for experienced developers.

## Methods

- **For loop with index:** Provides direct access to the index of each element, useful for modifying elements during iteration.
- **For-in loop:**  More concise and readable for simple iterations where the index is not needed.
- **forEach method:**  Functional approach, ideal for applying a function to each element.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the `bug.dart` file to see the output.  All three methods produce the same output in this example, but their efficiency can vary based on the context.
